# E-Commerce-Platform

This site consists of 3 sets of players: Platform, Sellers, Customers. 
Sellers offer Products through the Platform, which are viewed by Customers, who may then decide to order some of the products.
Customers interact with the system using the Customer Portal. Sellers attach themselves to the
platform, while the Portal is also connected to the platform. Thus all interactions between
customers and sellers are through the platform. 

The Portal allows customers to view the list of available product categories. For each category,
they can ask for a listing of available products. On viewing the listing (which can be sorted as
per their preference), they may choose to purchase one or more units of a given product. Once
sold, the product is no longer available to others.

When a customer makes a request (either for listing products or buying products), the portal
relays the request to the platform. The platform, in turn, sends the request to the relevant
sellers, and sends their response back to the portal.

Design approach:
● Platform: Provides a way for sellers to attach themselves to the platform. Receives
requests from the portal (see below), and passes those on to the registered sellers. Gets
their responses, and sends the consolidated response to the portal
● Seller: Maintain different categories of products, and different products within each
category. A seller can decide which products to offer, and the price for each item. Price
can change dynamically, from call to call. Seller also maintains the count of each product
and can only sell that many of a given product. . Each seller also assigns a unique name
for each product (for instance, it could be <seller name>-<product name>.
● Portal: Mimics the front-end of an application, though here it would be command line
based. Users can enter specified commands, which are passed to the platform. On
return, the portal sorts the list of products as per the preference of the user and displays
them
● Product: provides a common view of all products. You can query the object for its
category, unique name, price, and number available
● Subtypes of Product: For our purposes, we have two product categories: Book and
Mobile. These are derived classes of Product, and add methods relevant to them.
Implementation

For our implementation, to simplify connection between the platform and portal, we use files to
enable communication. The portal writes requests to a file which the platform reads, and
responses are written by the platform to a different file that the portal reads. For convenience,
we will call these PortalToPlatform.txt and PlatformToPortal.txt. Since responses may come
back after arbitrary delays, the portal will periodically check the file for responses. Similarly, the
platform periodically checks its input file for new commands.

Note: there are many ways of achieving these kinds of asynchronous interactions. For simplicity,
we use “polling”, and we let the user/operator decide when to check for messages/responses.
For instance, the user can type “check” in the portal to make the portal check for responses from
the platform. Similarly for the Platform end.

We run the main of the Java and C++ implementations - one the Platform and the other the
Portal - in different windows. The user types in requests in the Portal, and sees the responses
shown back in the same window. At the back, the Portal writes out requests as text messages in
the file PortalToPlatform.txt. Each request line has a unique id (say an integer). The platform,
when writing back the response in PlatformToPortal.txt, adds this request ID to the response
details.

The user can type any of the following commands:
● List Category SortOrder
○ shows list of products belonging to Category from all sellers who have that
Category, sorted by SortOrder, which is one of Price or Name
○ For each line, it shows:
Product name, productID, price, number available, and optionally other
information. Note that all these values are decided by each seller for the products
they offer. ProductID should be unique across all sellers and products.
● Buy productID numItems
○ wants to buy that many items of the specified productID. The seller should ideally
reduce their availability count. Also, you cannot buy more items than were
offered, Such attempts will not be successful.
● Check
○ Asks the portal to check if there is a response from the platform for an earlier
request.
● Note that the above commands can be called in any order. For instance there could be
multiple “Buy” commands after a “List” and without any “Check” in between.

For the Platform program, there is only one user input (e.g. Check) that is used to make the
platform check for input requests.
